## About

This project allows users to visit the website, register, and log in. Once logged in, users can browse the available products, search and filter items by category, and add them to their shopping cart. Users can add multiple items to the cart and adjust the quantity of each item. After updating the cart, users can proceed to checkout and enter their payment details. Once the payment is successful, the order is placed, and users can view their order details along with the shipping status.

The admin has an important role in this system. The admin can add new products to the store, update existing items, remove products, and manage the inventory. The admin can also view all orders and update their status (e.g., mark orders as shipped or delivered).

A **key feature** of this project is the email notifications for users. When a user registers, they will receive a confirmation email. Additionally, whenever a user places an order or when the order is shipped, they will receive an email with the details. If a product goes out of stock and a user tries to purchase it, they will be notified by email once the product is available again.

- **Note:** The payment page is for demonstration purposes only and is not connected to a real payment gateway. For now, any credit card details can be used to place a demo order.
